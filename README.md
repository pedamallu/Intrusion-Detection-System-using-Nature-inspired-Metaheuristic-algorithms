Increase the accuracy of the IDS by using Optimisation algorithms
The IDS has uncertain behaviour on the  traffic inside the network  because of its large computations. As it's needed to explore the large amount of features, the system complexity also increases. There is a very good chance that the features which are irrelevant and noisy can affect the efficiency of the system. A faster method is proposed for IDS by training machine learning models using NSL-KDD dataset. Many features in the NSL-KDD dataset are not useful to predict an attack. The noisy data has been removed by using Random Forest Classifier. Moreover, the selected features are used to train a feed-forward neural network with various meta-heuristic nature inspired algorithms, which gives good predictions on the test data. The proposed method can train the network to give an accuracy, detection rate and false alarm rate of 95.8%,97.5% and 2.8%. respectively. This method is efficient at identifying attacks in network traffic.
